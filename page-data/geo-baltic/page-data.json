The streamer length ranges from 4 x 4800 m at 100 m separation to a maximum of 4 x 6400 m or 1 x 12000 m.\n\nNavigation Aids: The vessel uses a Robertson AP9 MK 3 autopilot, equipped with a Robertson Autotrack ST5500. It employs both a Koden and Furuno GP31 GPS system, and an array of radar systems and gyroscopic devices. For accurate seismic work, it utilizes a Starlink differential GPS and advanced tracking systems.\n\nEnergy Source: The seismic source of the Geo Baltic comes from Sodera G-guns ranging from 20 to 250 cu. Inch. The vessel can achieve a maximum volume of 2 x 2620 cu. inch at 6 m. The firing control and QC are managed by a Seamap GunLink 2000 system.\n\nCommunication Systems: The M/V Geo Baltic is equipped with a comprehensive range of communication systems including GMDDS A1, A2 and A3, Inmarsat systems, GSM, M/F and H/F systems, and VHF systems both stationary and portable.\n\nAccommodation and Living Facilities: The vessel provides comfortable living spaces, with 14 single cabins and 19 double cabins, accommodating a total safe capacity of 52. It also features a spacious mess with a seating capacity of 30 and a day room of 44 m2.\n\n\nThe realm of marine vessels is rich with tales of transformations and unprecedented journeys. Today, we traverse through time to unravel the story of the M/V Geo Baltic, a ship that has evolved over decades, and assumed roles as diverse as its routes.\n\nOriginally serving as a vessel for the Swedish Navy during the 80s and early 90s, the M/V Geo Baltic bore witness to the tension-filled days of the Cold War. It was a silent spectator of the deep sea, meticulously tracking the movements of Soviet submarines and relaying information back to base. This part of its history is imbued with a sense of enigma, painted against the backdrop of a world bracing for the unpredictabilities of international relations.\n\nYet, time carries with it the promise of change. As the curtains fell on the Cold War, the M/V Geo Baltic was beckoned towards a different calling. The vessel was sold to Geoteam in 1998, a company that recognized its untapped potential for seismic surveying. With the deft hand of Geoteam, the ship underwent a significant conversion to equip it for its new role. By 2006, another conversion had turned it into an even more specialized seismic survey ship.\n\nThe M/V Geo Baltic then entered a new era, serving in seismic exploration projects, notably the high-density 3D and regional 2D marine seismic data acquisition project in the KJO offshore area of the Al-Khafji Joint Operations in 2007. While the missions had changed, the vessel's commitment to its purpose had not. This time, the M/V Geo Baltic was not just listening to the underwater world; it was helping map it.\n\nNavigating the sensitive geopolitical borders between Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and Iran, the vessel and its crew faced the challenging task of avoiding encroachments while conducting detailed seismic surveys. Despite the geopolitical tension and the technical challenges, the M/V Geo Baltic carried out its duties successfully.\n\nYet, these were not the only challenges the vessel faced. It had to navigate the complexity of managing long seismic cables before lateral streamer control became an industry standard. It faced the practical difficulties of sharing the waters with local fishermen placing nets during the nights, often having to remove fishing gear and inform them of the vessel's planned routes.\n\nNevertheless, the M/V Geo Baltic persevered and emerged triumphant in these testing times, demonstrating the vessel's resilience, adaptability, and technical prowess.\n\nSadly, according to the last available data, the M/V Geo Baltic was last seen in October 2021.

Although its current whereabouts or status may be unknown, the M/V Geo Baltic remains an illustrious figure in the maritime world.\n\nThe story of the M/V Geo Baltic is an homage to the dynamic and ever-evolving nature of the maritime industry. From the world of military intelligence to the realm of geological surveying, this vessel has traversed more than just the physical seas. It has navigated the currents of change, demonstrating time and again the adaptability and resilience inherent in the world of maritime operations. In its journey, the M/V Geo Baltic has left an indelible mark on the maritime world, and it continues to inspire those navigating the waters today.","html":"<p>Vessel Specifications:<br><strong>General Overview:</strong> The M/V Geo Baltic has a length of 73m and a beam of 15.5/17.52m.
