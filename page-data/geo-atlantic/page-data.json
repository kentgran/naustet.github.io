This technical report provides an overview of the vessel's specifications, transformations, and operational history.\n\nSpecifications: The M/V Geo Atlantic was a large-capacity 3D seismic vessel with a length of 121.00 m, a moulded breadth of 22.00 m, a moulded depth of 9.650 m, a gross tonnage of 13,398 tons, and a deadweight of approximately 5,600 tons. The vessel was classified as DnV 1A1, Dynpos-AUTR, RP, E0, W1, Heldk-SH.\n\nTransformations: Constructed in 2000 by Flekkefjord Slipp- & Maskinfabrikk, the vessel initially operated under the name \"Polar King\". It underwent its first conversion at Ulstein Verft, where it was transformed into a cable layer and renamed \"Oceanic King\". In 2006, the vessel was converted into a seismic acquisition vessel at Drammen Skipsreparasjon and took on the name \"Geo Atlantic\". In 2013, following a retrofit at Sembawang Shipyard in Singapore, the vessel was renamed \"Polar Marquis\".\n\nOperational History: During its operational years, the M/V Geo Atlantic was owned and operated by Rieber Shipping ASA. The vessel was equipped with advanced seismic equipment, enabling it to conduct comprehensive seismic surveys. These surveys were crucial in providing detailed images of the Earth's subsurface, which were instrumental in the exploration and production of hydrocarbons.\n\nIn November 2019, the Polar Marquis experienced an engine fire off the coast of Senegal. The incident led to the decision by Shearwater, the vessel's operator at the time, not to repair the vessel. Consequently, the Polar Marquis was decommissioned and scrapped in 2020.\n\nThroughout its operational life, the M/V Geo Atlantic underwent several transformations to meet the evolving needs of the marine geophysical services industry. Despite its eventual decommissioning, the vessel's contributions to seismic research remain significant. Its technical capabilities and adaptability serve as a testament to the advancements in marine geophysical technology and the industry's commitment to exploring and understanding the Earth's subsurface.","html":"<p>The M/V Geo Atlantic, later known as the Polar Marquis, was a seismic vessel that played a significant role in marine geophysical services from 2000 until its decommissioning in 2020.
