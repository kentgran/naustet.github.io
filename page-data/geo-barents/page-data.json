In 2012, as part of the second phase of Spectrum's multi-client 3D survey in the Levantine Basin, offshore Lebanon, Geo Barents was instrumental in acquiring 1,200 sq km of long-offset seismic data by towing eight streamers, an achievement given that the vessel was initially designed to tow six streamers.

This mission required the vessel to use a Kongsberg HUGIN 4500 autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to scan the search area, revealing significant undersea topographical features.\n\nPresent Role and Legal Challenges\n\nThe vessel has more recently been chartered by the humanitarian organisation Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors Without Borders) for rescue operations in the Mediterranean Sea, marking another shift in its operational profile.
